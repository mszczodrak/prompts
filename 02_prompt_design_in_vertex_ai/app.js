"The applicant is seeking coverage for their 50,000 sq ft warehouse. The business is 5 years old. The building is a concrete tilt-up structure, originally built in 2010. They store a variety of non-hazardous dry goods.
Fire safety measures include a full sprinkler system, a centrally monitored fire alarm, and documented annual inspections by a certified third party.
Security measures include a 24/7 centrally monitored burglar alarm, comprehensive security camera coverage of the interior and exterior, a fully fenced perimeter, and nightly patrols by a contracted security guard service.
The company reports no major property or liability losses in their 5-year history. They have specifically asked to ensure their new automated shelving and retrieval system, installed last month, is adequately covered under the policy."

Your Task:
1. Briefly summarize the key details of the 'SafeHarbor Warehousing' business and its existing safety measures.
2. Based *only* on the notes provided, identify any immediate questions an underwriter should ask or potential risk factors they should consider further.
Present the summary first, then the questions/risk factors as bullet points.`};
