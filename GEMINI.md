# Gemini

Gemini is a family of powerful generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind, capable of understanding and generating various forms of content, including text, code, images, audio, and video.

Gemini API in Vertex AI

The Gemini API in Vertex AI provides a unified interface for interacting with Gemini models. This allows developers to easily integrate these powerful AI capabilities into their applications. For the most up-to-date details and specific features of the latest versions, please refer to the official Gemini documentation.

## Gemini Models

- Gemini Pro: Designed for complex reasoning, including:
-- Analyzing and summarizing large amounts of information.
-- Sophisticated cross-modal reasoning (across text, code, images, etc.).
-- Effective problem-solving with complex codebases.

- Gemini Flash: Optimized for speed and efficiency, offering:
-- Sub-second response times and high throughput.
-- High quality at a lower cost for a wide range of tasks.
-- Enhanced multimodal capabilities, including improved spatial understanding, new output modalities (text, audio, images), and native tool use (Google Search, code execution, and third-party functions).
